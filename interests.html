                        <p>Iâ€™m just your neighborhood freelance software engineer, that loves all aspects of technology. I wholeheartedly love people, and find satisfaction solving their problems and bringing their ideas into reality.<br><br> I received my Bachelor's Degree from Troy University, studying Computer Science and Global Business, while also playing college football.<br><br> I've played an integral role on several business teams from product design, to marketing and financial decision-making. For me, hands on experience gave me a deeper understanding of how technology and business operations are interdependent.
